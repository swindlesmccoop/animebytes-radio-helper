# AnimeBytes Radio Helper

## Usage

### Dependencies
#### System dependencies:
```
libnotify, mpv
```

### Running/Installing
I made this primarily to be invoked with a keybind, however it can be invoked from the shell as well. Simply clone the repo and run `make install` inside. In order to invoke the radio, enter the command `abr-listen`. In order to stop it, run `abr-kill`.
